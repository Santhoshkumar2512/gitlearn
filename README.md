# Welcome to Our Git Repository

This repository contains the source code for our project. Here's how to get started:

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Git: You can download and install Git from [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/).

## Cloning the Repository

To clone this repository to your local machine, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of this repository.

## Usage

Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory using the `cd` command:

```bash
cd <project-directory>
```

Replace `<project-directory>` with the name of the directory containing the cloned repository.

### Pulling Changes

Before you start working on the project, it's a good idea to pull the latest changes from the remote repository:

```bash
git pull
```

This command will sync your local repository with the changes made by others.

### Making Changes

To make changes to the code, edit the files in your local repository using your preferred text editor.

### Adding Changes

Once you've made your changes, you need to stage them for commit using the `git add` command:

```bash
git add .
```

This command stages all changes in the current directory for commit. You can also specify individual files to stage.

### Committing Changes

After staging your changes, commit them to the repository with a descriptive message using the `git commit` command:

```bash
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message here"
```

### Pushing Changes

Finally, push your committed changes to the remote repository using the `git push` command:

```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```

Replace `<branch-name>` with the name of the branch you want to push your changes to, typically `master` or `main`.
